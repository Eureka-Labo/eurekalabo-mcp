## Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Use natural language**: Just tell Claude what you want to work on
   - "Start working on authentication" â†’ Auto-creates task
   - "I'm done with the auth feature" â†’ Auto-completes task

ðŸ’¡ **One command PR creation**: `/eureka complete --pr` does everything
   - Completes task
   - Captures all changes
   - Creates PR
   - Links everything together

ðŸ’¡ **Team visibility**: All tasks visible in Eureka dashboard
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Who's working on what
   - Complete change history
